## What this is

MCP server for uk-farm-grants-mcp.

Part of the Ansvar MCP fleet — source-available servers published for self-hosting.

## Two ways to use it

**Self-host (free, Apache 2.0)** — clone this repo, run the ingestion script
to build your local database from the listed upstream sources, point your MCP
client at the local server. Instructions below.

**Trial the hosted gateway (paid pilot, B2B)** — for production use against
the curated, kept-fresh corpus across the full Ansvar MCP fleet at once, with
citation enrichment, multi-jurisdiction fan-out, and audit-ledgered query
logs, see [ansvar.eu](https://ansvar.eu).

## Self-hosting

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ansvar-Systems/uk-farm-grants-mcp.git
cd uk-farm-grants-mcp
npm install
```

### Build the database

```bash
npm run ingest
```

Ingestion fetches from the upstream source(s) listed under **Sources** below and builds a local SQLite database. Re-run periodically to refresh. Inspect the ingestion script (`scripts/ingest-*.ts` or `scripts/ingest-*.py`) for the actual access method (open API, bulk download, HTML scrape, or feed) and review the source's published terms before running it in a commercial deployment.

### Configure your MCP client

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uk-farm-grants-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/http-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## What this repository does not provide

This repository contains only the MCP server code, schema, and ingestion
scripts. It does not include, redistribute, or license the upstream materials.

Running ingestion may download, cache, transform, and index materials from the
listed upstream sources. You are responsible for confirming that your use of
those materials complies with the source terms, attribution requirements,
robots/rate limits, database rights, copyright rules, and any commercial-use or
redistribution limits that apply in your jurisdiction. The license below
covers the code in this repository only.

## License

Apache 2.0 — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Commercial use, modification, and
redistribution of **the source code in this repository** are permitted under
that license. The license does not extend to upstream materials downloaded by
the ingestion script; those remain governed by their respective source terms
listed above.

## The Ansvar gateway

If you'd rather not self-host, [ansvar.eu](https://ansvar.eu) provides this
MCP plus the full Ansvar fleet through a single OAuth-authenticated endpoint,
with the curated production corpus, multi-MCP query orchestration, citation
enrichment, and (on the company tier) a per-tenant cryptographic audit
ledger. Pilot mode, B2B only.
